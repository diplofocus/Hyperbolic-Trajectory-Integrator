Documentation.

Below is a list of files that compose this code and the uses of said files.

main.cpp
{
	Contains the code necessary for running the simulation.
	Creates galaxies, gives them velocities and integrates them.
	It does this by invoking methods from other files.
	Only the integration method is defined here.
}

node.h/node.cpp
{
	Contains the declarations and definitions used in the constructions and operation of the Barnes Hut tree code.
	Contains functions for inserting bodies in to a node, distributing mass along the nodes, and calculating the forces that act upon a body by traversing a node.
}

galaxy.h/galaxy.cpp
{
	Contains the declarations and definitions used in the construction of galaxies as stable body formations.
	Requires the user to forward a pointer to a list of bodies.
	By default it places galaxies in parabolic trajerctories around each other, but this can easily be changed.
	The galaxies themselves are consisted of five concentric rings and every particle has a uniform angular momentum.
	The first particle is placed in the center and acts as a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH), but it's mass is far greater than
	a real SMBH because it also serves as the bulge of the galaxy.
}

bodies.h/bodies.cpp
{
	Contains the declarations and definitions of the particle class used throughout the simulation.
